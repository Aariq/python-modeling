# Modeling Biological Systems with Python
This repository contains assignments, class notes, and a final project from [EE194](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/ee/194MSO/) at Tufts Universtiy from Spring 2018.
The Final Project folder contains an independent final project.  My goal was to create a function to simulate a population of turtles over time with an individual based model.  The function takes matrix model inputs (class-based survival and birth rates) and converts them into an individual based model over time.  Function arguments allow the control of individual variation in survival rates as well as year-to-year stochastic variation.  The .RMD file in the final project is an R script to plot the results output by the function.  Learning plotting in Python is still on my to-do list ;-)
